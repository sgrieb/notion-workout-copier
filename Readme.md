# Notion workout copier

Overview

- Every Monday morning, copy the most recently created workout page
- Rename it to Week [N] - [current_date]
- Uncheck all done boxes
- Run this locally^
- Once it works, move to aws lambda and run on schedule

# Unexpected BS
- no docs on js client
- weird inconsistent datatypes
- super abstracted types make it confusing af
- had to remap select options for difficulty column
- had to create order column so we can maintain row order :facepalm
